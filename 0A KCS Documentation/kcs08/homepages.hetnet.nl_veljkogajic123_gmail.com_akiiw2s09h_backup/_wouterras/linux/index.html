<h1>Getting Linux to run together with Windows on a FAT32 partition</h1>
This page contains some problems ...and solutions to those problems, that I encountered during
and after the installation of RedHat Linux on my system.<br>
First of all, let me state that I'm not a <i>Linux wizard</i>. I just made this page, hoping that
it can be of some use to those who have simular problems.
<br><br>
When reading, you'll find that there's no particular structure in this page.
It's just a summary several problems and their solutions:<br>
<ol>
<a href="#splithd"><li>Splitting your partition without destroying the data on it</a>
<a href="#RPMSproblem"><li>"Can't locate the RPMS directory"...</a>

<h3>Splitting your partition without destroying the data on it</h3>
I downloaded <b>RedHat 5.2</b> from an FTP site, and ran the hard drive install, although I now think
I could have saved myself a lot of trouble by just buying the damned CD-ROM. Anyway, the first
problem I ran into after having collected all the files on my harddrive, was that I needed to
split up the Windows partition on my C: drive. An easy way to do this, without destroying data
on the existing Windows partition(s) is to use FIPS, available on lots of FTP sites.

<a name="RPMSproblem">
<h3>Can't locate the RPMS directory...</h3>
The second problem was that RedHat install wasn't able to locate the RPMS directory... A very
frustrating problem this was, because I could see it <b>was</b> there! I think the problem lies 
in the fact that in the FAT32 system Linux reads "RPMS" as "rpms". It must be altered from 
the Linux command prompt. The solution to this problem is as follows (I found it somewhere on
the www, unfortunately I don't know where anymore):<br>
<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="mv.zip">mv</a> program and unpack it (it's a zip archive) and store it 
in the same partition as the rest of your Linux installation files. Hereafter it is assumed to 
be in the RedHat directory (where the RPMS subdirectory also is).
<li>Start Install and make note of the Linux device associated with the install partition (e.g.
  /dev/hdb1).
<li>Continue until the message "error opening directory" appears. Now hit <b>&#60;Alt+F2&#62;</b> to get to   the Linux command prompt.
<li>Type <b><tt>ls /tmp/hdimage</tt></b>. A listing of the files on the FAT installation partition should
  appear.
<li>Type <b><tt>umount /tmp/hdimage</tt></b> to un-mount the partition.
<li>Type <b><tt>mount -t vfat {devicename} /tmp/hdimage</tt></b> to re-mount the partition. {devicename} is
  the one as found above (e.g. /dev/hdb1). Now there is read-write access to the partition.
<li>Type <b><tt>cd /tmp/hdimage/RedHat</tt></b>. If RedHat is not in the root of that partition, you need
  to insert the subdirectories here.
<li>Now type <b><tt>ls</tt></b> to be sure you're in the right directory. You should see the rpms directory,
  the mv file among others.
<li>Type <b><tt>./mv rpms temp</tt></b>. You may also choose another filename than "temp".
<li>Now type <b><tt>./mv temp RPMS</tt></b>. Please note the uppercase.
<li>Go to the root directory by typing <b><tt>cd /</tt></b>
<li>Type <b><tt>umount /tmp/hdimage</tt></b>.
<li>Finally, hit <b>&#60;Alt+F1&#62;</b> to return to the installation screen. Hit the OK button and then retry
the operation. The installation should now proceed correctly.

<h3>LOADLIN or LILO?</h3>
When the installation is almost done, you're asked where you would like to store the Linux Loader (LILO),
either in the master boot sector or in the /boot partition. Because of the trouble I had before
with the FAT32 partition, and the fact that Disk Druid did not recognize FAT32 at all, I decided to skip
the installation of LILO, and use LOADLIN. I don't know if my fears of data loss in the FAT32 partition
were justified or not... now I don't care anymore, because I think using LOADLIN is pretty comfortable.
Here's what I did:<br>
<ol>
<li>I created a directory on the C: drive, called LINUX, and copied the files LOADLIN.EXE and the zImages
(I have two, 2.0.36 and 2.2.5 - I named them 2_0_36 and 2_2_5) to it.
<li>Then I inserted the following lines into my <b>config.sys</b> file at the top:
  <blockquote><tt>
  [menu]<br>
  menuitem=Win95,Windows 95<br>
  menuitem=Linux2036,Linux Kernel 2.0.36<br>
  menuitem=Linux225,Linux Kernel 2.2.5<br>
  menucolor=15,1<br>
  menudefault=Linux225,7<br>
  <br>
  [Linux2036]<br>
  shell=C:\LINUX\LOADLIN.EXE C:\LINUX\2_0_36 mem=xxM root=/dev/hdaY ro<br>
  <br>
  [Linux225]<br>
  shell=C:\LINUX\LOADLIN.EXE C:\LINUX\2_2_5 mem=xxM root=/dev/hdaY ro<br>
  <br>
  [Win95]<br>
  ...here the rest of config.sys...
  </tt></blockquote>
  <b>Please note that the parameters (mem, root) depend on your own configuration.</b><br>
  The root-parameter (/dev/hdaY) points to the partition where the root (/) is located. In my
  case this is /dev/hda6.<br>
  The parameter mem=xxM is there, because on my computer Linux limited the RAM size to about
  14M, unless the memory size was explicitedly mentioned! I have 96M of RAM, so in
  my case I entered mem=96M
<li>When turning on my computer, a start-up menu is shown. If a choice has not been made within 7
  seconds, Linux is booted with kernel version 2.2.5.

<a name="modules">
<h3>Next problem: Can't locate modules...</h3>
The next problem I ran into, and which took me about a whole week of frustration to solve, was
that modules could not be found, which meant that I could not make a PPP connection (I got the message "This system
lacks kernel support for PPP. This could be because the PPP kernel module is not loaded, or
because the kernel is not configured for PPP."<br>
After reinstalling the system about four times, changing about every file, I finally found the
solution, which was quite simple really, and completely the result of my own stupidity: The VMLINUZ
image (loaded by LOADLIN) that I downloaded from the same site that I downloaded the complete RedHat
package from, turned out to be different from the one that is installed in the /boot partition. 
All I had to do was copy that file (i.e. vmlinuz-2.0.36-0.7 - or whatever version you have) to 
C:\LINUX (either directly if you manage to get vfat running or via a floppy) and overwrite the old VMLINUZ file.
From then on the system booted ok, and all modules were loaded ...and without 'unresolved symbols'. :-)

<h3>Another problem: Creating a ppp connection</h3>
This problem is about establishing a connection to my local ISP ...dus in 't Nederlands maar:<br>
Vrij lang kon ik fijn met Linux spelen, maar geen verbinding maken met Casema met behulp van het
kabelmodem. Ik had ppp geprepareerd zoals staat op <a href="http://www.casema.net/~cvgennip/kabelmodem/">
http://www.casema.net/~cvgennip/kabelmodem/</a>, maar toch kreeg ik telkens de melding:
"PAP-authentication failed... STOP-CODE 05-00".<br>
Dat het me uiteindelijk toch gelukt is om verbinding te leggen is meer geluk dan wijsheid. Ik heb
nu telefoonnummer <b>3</b> gekozen en <i>PAP-authentication</i> <b>uit</b> gezet. Je ziet dan in het 
<i>Edit PPP interface</i> scherm, bij het expect-send gedeelte iets als:
<blockquote><tt>ogin: MIJNNAAM<br>
ord: MIJNWACHTWOORD<br>
</tt></blockquote>
En dat werkt prima.

<h3>Automatic power-off on shutdown / recompiling the kernel</h3>
On my computer, it is possible to automatically turn off power on shutdown. This
happens whenever I shut down <nobr>Windows 95</nobr>, but it didn't happen when shutting down Linux.<br>
If you have the same problem, here's what you should do: Edit the file <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/halt</b>. There is a
line in there, saying something like <tt>command="halt"</tt>. Change it so that it
reads <tt>command="halt -p"</tt>.<br>
On my computer this had no effect though. It turned out that my Kernel (2.0.36) 
did not support this feature. So I had to upgrade and recompile it. Of course,
it's all explained in the HOWTO's, but here's a summary of how to do it:<br>
<ol><li>Download the kernel you'd like to have from
<a href="http://ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/</a>
or from a mirror site. The Kernel files have the format <i>Linux-x.y.z.tar.gz</i>, where
x.y.z is the version number. If you like, you can check your current version by typing <tt>uname -r</tt>.
<li>Login as root, and change to <b>/usr/src</b>
<li>Unpack the kernel source with <tt>tar zxpvf linux-x.y.z.tar.gz</tt>
<li>Change to <b>linux</b> and read the README file, especially the section
INSTALLING about the necessary symlinks and the removal of stale .o files.
<li>Now, enter <tt>make config</tt>, or a lot nicer - if you have XWindows
installed: <tt>make xconfig</tt> and select all things you want to have compiled
into your kernel or as a module.
<li>Enter <tt>make dep</tt>
<li>Enter <tt>make clean</tt>. When recompiling, do not forget this step.
<li>Enter <tt>make zImage</tt>, or <tt>make bzImage</tt>, or whatever setup
you want to have. The image and other files will be stored in the <b>arch/i386/boot</b>
directory.<br>
I myself use LoadLin from a Win95 startup menu, so all I have to do now, is copy
the zImage to the right directory on my C: hard disk. It's wise to keep a backup
of your original zImage in case something goes wrong (e.g. you forgot to compile
the ext2 filesystem into your kernel). You could, for instance,
also add a menu item to the startup menu, one booting <nobr><i>Linux Kernel x.y.z</i></nobr> 
and another booting <nobr><i>Linux Kernel q.r.s</i></nobr>.
<li>Now all that's left is the compilation and installation of the modules:
Enter <tt>make modules</tt>
<li>Enter: <tt>make modules_install</tt>
</ol>
And your new kernel is ready for use!

<h3>Can't locate modules net-pf-4 and net-pf-5, ppp-compress-21,
ppp-compress-24 and ppp-compress-26</h3>
After having recompiled my kernel, I noticed that on boot some modules
couldn't be found, namely net-pf-4 and net-pf-5. I searched usenet and found
that net-pf-4 is IPX and net-pf-5 is Appletalk, which I both did not include
in my new kernel, because I don't need them. In order to remove the error
message, I added the following lines to <b>/etc/conf.modules</b>:<br>
<blockquote><tt>alias net-pf-4 off<br>alias net-pf-5 off</tt></blockquote>
This way, the system is told not to look for those modules.<br><br>
When establishing a ppp-connection, there seemed to be no problem, but looking
at <b>/var/log/messages</b> I noticed that the modules
<nobr>ppp-compress-21,</nobr> <nobr>ppp-compress-24</nobr> and
<nobr>ppp-compress-26</nobr> could not be located, and I could indeed see that
there were not compiled in <b>/lib/modules/2.2.5/net</b>. However, again
searching usenet, I found that these are aliases and also needed to be entered
in <b>/etc/conf.modules</b>:<br>
<blockquote><tt>alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp<br>alias ppp-compress-24
ppp_deflate<br>alias ppp-compress-26 slhc</tt></blockquote>
Now reboot and the problem has been solved.
